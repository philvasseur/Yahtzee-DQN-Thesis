        <h2>Using Deep Q-Learning to Compare Strategy Ladders of Yahtzee</h1>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>"Bots" playing games is not a new concept, likely going back to the first video games. However, there has been a new wave recently using machine learning to learn to play games at a near optimal level - essentially using neural networks to "solve" games. Depending on the game, this can be relatively straight forward using supervised learning. However, this requires having data for optimal play, which is often not possible due to the sheer complexity of many games. For example, solitaire Yahtzee has this data available, but two player Yahtzee does not due to the massive state space. A recent trend in response to this started with Google Deep Mind in 2013, who used Deep Reinforcement Learning to play various Atari games.</p>

        <p>This project will apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (specifically Deep Q-Learning) and measure how an agent learns to play Yahtzee in the form of a strategy ladder. A strategy ladder is a way of looking at how the performance of an AI varies with the computational resources it uses. Different sets of rules changes how the the AI learns which varies the strategy ladder itself. This project will vary the upper bonus threshold and then attempt to measure how "good" the various strategy ladders are - in essence attempting to find the set of rules which creates the "best" version of Yahtzee. We assume/expect that there is some correlation between strategy ladders for AI and strategy ladders for human, meaning that a game with a "good" strategy ladder for an AI indicates that game is interesting and challenging for humans.</p>
